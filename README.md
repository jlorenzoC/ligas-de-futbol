# Ligas de f√∫tbol

Example application to manage football soccer leagues. The data the app feeds from, will be provided by a simulated API with the help of `json-server` server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Development servers

- **Fake api:** Install fake api server by an only one time execution of `npm install -g json-server`, and then, run `json-server --watch fake-database.json` every time you need to enable your fake api. The fake api will be exposed at `localhost:3000`. This server is powered by [json-server at NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), for more info on how it works, please check the link before.

- **Source code:** Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
